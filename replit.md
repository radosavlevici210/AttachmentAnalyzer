## Data Flow

### Project Creation Flow
1. User creates a new project through the studio interface
2. Project data is validated using Zod schemas
3. Project is stored in PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
4. Real-time updates are managed through TanStack Query

### AI Generation Flow
1. User submits generation request (movie, music, voice, or analysis)
2. Request is validated and processed by respective service
3. OpenAI API is called with structured prompts
4. Generation results are stored and linked to the project
5. Frontend receives updates and displays results

### Data Persistence
- Projects and generations are stored in PostgreSQL
- JSON fields store flexible content data and settings
- Timestamps track creation and modification dates
- User sessions are managed with PostgreSQL-backed storage
